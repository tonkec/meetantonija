# Error Boundary in React

While I was building this app, my personal website, I found myself looking at the exception when I visited nested route with random param. Let me start from the beginning. This project has several routes and some of them are nested. You might have noticed, when you visit one of the projects I worked on, the url looks something like this [project/trustworthy](https://www.meetantonija.com/#/project/trustworthy)

That means my route looks like this

```
<Route path="/project/:id" element={<Project />} />
```

where id is the title of the project which I read using useParams hook. But what about some random route, like [project/something](https://www.meetantonija.com/#/project/something). That little random param used to broke my whole application, until I met ErrorBoundary. Basically, what it does is it catches error in any of the child components. It is like a catch function for the components. I tried to use the npm package react-error-boundary, but it had some issuees with refreshing the component after an error is caught. Therefore I decided to build my own component. Note that Error Boundary can only work as a class component. Why? Well, we need the good old life cycle methods like componentDidCatch and componentDidUpdate. Remember those guys? Here is what I ended up implementing:

```
interface Props {
  children: ReactNode;
  location: { pathname: string };
}

interface State {
  hasError: boolean;
}

class ErrorBoundary extends Component<Props, State> {
  public state: State = {
    hasError: false,
  };

  public static getDerivedStateFromError(_: Error): State {
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  public componentDidCatch(error: Error, errorInfo: ErrorInfo) {
    console.error('Uncaught error:', error, errorInfo);
  }

  componentDidUpdate(prevProps: { location: { pathname: string } }) {
    if (prevProps.location.pathname !== this.props.location.pathname) {
      this.setState({ hasError: false });
    }
  }

  public render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return <Error heading="That is an error!" icon={() => <AiFillBug />} />;
    }

    return this.props.children;
  }
}

export default ErrorBoundary;

```

The most important part for me was this block of code:

```
componentDidUpdate(prevProps: { location: { pathname: string } }) {
    if (prevProps.location.pathname !== this.props.location.pathname) {
      this.setState({ hasError: false });
    }
}
```

When location has changed, meaning when I click the link to go back to the homepage, the hasError state would be changed to false, causing ErrorBoundary to stop rendering and actually render the homepage. My routes were now wrapped in that class component:

```
<ErrorBoundary location={location}>
    <Routes location={location} key={location.pathname}>
        <Route path="/" element={<Homepage />} />
        <Route path="/project/:id" element={<Project />} />
    </Routes>
</ErrorBoundary>
```

Notice the location prop on the ErrorBoundary component. I had to do a great reserach until I figured it out where to place that location prop exactly. All of this is wrapped in the another component called HashRouter which I am going to cover in some of my next notes.

```
<HashRouter>
    <Routes />
</HashRouter>
```
