              With a decade of experience in front-end development, I bring a
              wealth of technical expertise to the table. I've mastered various
              technologies, frameworks, and tools, allowing me to create robust
              and responsive user interfaces with ease. My problem-solving
              skills are finely honed after years of tackling challenges in
              front-end development. I have a knack for identifying issues,
              debugging code efficiently, and finding creative solutions to
              complex problems. Attention to detail is one of my strengths. I
              understand the importance of pixel-perfect precision in
              implementing designs across different devices and browsers,
              ensuring high-quality user experiences every time.

          <h2>ðŸ“– My story</h2>

          <p>
            In 2013, I found myself in the depths of depression, yearning for
            change and renewal. It was during this challenging time that I
            stumbled upon coding as a beacon of hope. Initially, I immersed
            myself in the world of Ruby on Rails, seeking to unlock its secrets
            and find a sense of purpose. However, the journey proved to be
            daunting, and I struggled to find my footing in its intricate
            landscape. Determined to persevere, I decided to pivot towards
            front-end development, driven by my affinity for visual expression.
            With HTML, CSS, and jQuery as my tools, I embarked on a journey of
            creativity and discovery. As I crafted digital masterpieces with
            transitions and animations, I felt a sense of exhilaration and joy
            wash over me, as if I had finally found my true calling.
          </p>

          <p>
            By 2018, my coding journey took a significant turn as I encountered
            React. Its simplicity and elegant syntax resonated deeply with me,
            and I was captivated by its ability to streamline the development
            process. With React, I found myself embracing a new paradigm of
            building user interfaces, one that prioritized clarity and
            efficiency.
          </p>

          <p>
            Through coding, I not only found solace in the midst of turmoil but
            also discovered a newfound passion that ignited my spirit. It was a
            journey marked by challenges and triumphs, darkness and light. Yet,
            through it all, coding remained a constant source of inspiration and
            transformation, turning despair into creativity and hope.
