The architecture is really complex and it required seniorty level of knowledge. We were using some services like Contentful, Cloudflare and Keycloak. I was part of the scrum ceremonies. One of the latest task was to enable US players to see the correct error message. Since US players are not allowed to use this app, they were supposed the see the error message customized for them. They were getting general error, instead of US error message. My task was to detect location of the player and then display the correct error message.",

I then had to send data from the form, as well as the data from the previous step, to the API. If there was an error in the form, it should be displayed to the user. The whole integration had to show states based on the connection status. I do not usually code in Angular, that is why this project had steep learning curve. I was able to quickly pick up core Angular and RxJs concepts. I also implemented different layout based on the status of internet connection. I learned a lot about service workers which I used here for caching assets.",

My task was to create user interface following designs from designer and to connect components via API provided by backend developers. User authorization was handled with tokens. I loved working on this project because I was able to get my hands on Context API and React hooks <3. I used Context API for flash messages and hooks in the stateful functional components. The cool part in login and signup form was custom made captcha. Originally, additions were much complex, but client wanted simplified captcha. Now user should know how to sum two numbers that are not larger than 10. I also really much enjoyed playing with CSS animations and transitions. The most valuable page to client was referral program page which has animation that I coded from scratch. The tricky part was reversing animation. I learned scss can not count nth children backwards.",

      "description": "The main technologies required for this project were HTML, CSS, Scss and JS and some fundamental knowledge in Django architecture. I have been developing content and learning material for students. The content I wrote provided students with up to date knowledge about the mandatory skills needed for web development: HTML, CSS, CSS animations and transitions, responsive web design, JS and Scss. After that, students were given challenges where they could practice on real-life examples. Except for challenges, I created a quiz for each lesson that tested student's knowledge as well. The other task was audio and video material that complements the rest of the content. The task was to implement plenty of new components into an existing LMS based on Django: quizzes, embedded repl.it, sidebar, course content, header, footer. I coded the interface of every course module. I was provided with the design files. It required CSS and Scss skills. The existing LMS code was slow and messy. I improved it with Scss logic. Now it is much cleaner and faster. I liked working with a designer, he had a really good eye for modern and contemporary design. I have been mentoring (remotely) for several years at Code Institute. The major part of the mentorship sessions is focusing on the code quality of students' projects. I help students to think like professional developers from the very start of their coding career. The content agnosticism, don't repeat yourself, reusability and object orientation are principles that I encourage on every session. I advise my students to stay persistent, committed and curious.",
