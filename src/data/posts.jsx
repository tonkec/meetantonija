      'I have a small trauma when it comes to this little array method in Javascript. I got asked in an interview to sort some array and I could not remember by my heart what does a sort function looks like. I always google it. That is why I decided to write a post about it, mainly to teach myself once and for all, how its syntax looks like. Here is an array with random numbers. If you want to sort it from the smallest number to the biggest number, just use minus operator for two parameters.',

      "Of course I know what lexical means, this is one of the rare cases where my diploma in linguistics helps me ðŸ’ª. But still it was confusing to apply that knowledge to Javascript. Let's dive in! First things first. Lexical in general means a definition, an explanation, a meaning. It points to the definition part of the object in contrast to the execution.",

      'I have been hearing about pure functions for a while now. I know that they are good and I should use them. But I never really understood why. I decided to write a post about it to clarify it for myself and for others. Here is a short explanation. Pure functions are functions that always return the same output if the input is the same. They do not have side effects. They are predictable and easy to test.',

It is called nullish coalescing operator. It returns the right-hand operand when the left-hand operand is null or undefined.',
