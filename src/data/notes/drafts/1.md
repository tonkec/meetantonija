# How to stretch height to match the parent's

While I was coding this website, I often ran into problem of keeping the height of a child the same as the height of parent. It occurs when using `min-height` property. This is the HMTL of the problem:

```html
<div class="relative">
  <div class="h-full">Some content</div>
</div>
```

and this is the CSS:

```css
.relative {
  position: relative;
  min-height: 400px;
  border: 2px solid red;
}

.h-full {
  height: 100%;
  border: 2px solid green;
}
```

I would expect the child to follow the `min-height` of the parent, but it does not. [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/21836870) suggest adding `1px` height to the parent. It seems like it works, but if I add content to the child, it will not follow the height of the parent. In other words, if the parent is set to be a minimum height of `400px` and if the content in the child is higher than those `400px` it will fall out of the child container.

The solution I prefer comes with allmighty `flex`.

To understand this, I would like to introduce the difference between `height`, `min-height` and `max-height` and how they work together.
