            This is an app for management of oil, gas and water pipelines. PIMSF
            was originally coded in Symfony, but client requested React.js app.
            That means that team of developers is "transforming" old PHP code
            into ES6 in React.

              The explorer is the most important part of the app. My task was to
              add the existing D3/DC charts and make them draggable and
              resizable. I achieved that using react-grid-layout npm package.
              The first thing I did was creating a plain draggable and resizable
              8 column grid as requested. After that, I added graphs to columns.
              As user resizes column, graph should follow height and width of
              that column, of its parent. I sent resizedHeight and resizedWidth
              variable to the redux store and passed them to width and height in
              D3 attribute. When charts were resizable and draggable, I worked
              on responsiveness of the grid. React-grid-layout comes with the
              built-in properties and functions to create a grid based on the
              breakpoint. I used one function that will take number of columns
              and a breakpoint as parameters.

            <dd class="yellow-selection">
              PIMSF can display different version of pipelines. If a constructor
              in the field changes something on the pipeline, they should report
              changes in the app. That report should create a new version of the
              pipeline. Such pipeline in PIMSF is perceived as a virtual
              pipeline. My task was to create a changelog history tree that will
              display each version of a pipeline. This is displayed as a tree
              where each new version is treated as a child, and each old version
              as a parent. We used Mermaid.js package to display such tree.
              Axios was used to get data points from API. Each pipeline in the
              tree can be deleted or approved. If it is approved, pipeline
              should change color to green. If it is deleted, it should be
              deleted from the history tree.
