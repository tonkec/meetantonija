            Code Institute is Dublin based bootcamp that trains students from
            zero to hero, turning them into real porfessional developers with
            large scope of skills, in front-end and back-end. Students with
            diploma from Code Institute are eligible to apply to almost any
            software developer job.

            The main technologies required for this project were HTML, CSS, Scss
            and JS and some fundamental knowledge in Django architecture.

              I have been developing content and learning material for students.
              The content I wrote provided students with up to date knowledge
              about the mandatory skills needed for web development: HTML, CSS,
              CSS animations and transitions, responsive web design, JS and
              Scss. After that, students were given challenges where they could
              practice on real-life examples. Except for challenges, I created a
              quiz for each lesson that tested student's knowledge as well. The
              other task was audio and video material that complements the rest
              of the content. <br />

              The task was to implement plenty of new components into an
              existing LMS based on Django: quizzes, embedded repl.it, sidebar,
              course content, header, footer. I coded the interface of every
              course module. I was provided with the design files. It required
              CSS and Scss skills. The existing LMS code was slow and messy. I
              improved it with Scss logic. Now it is much cleaner and faster. I
              liked working with a designer, he had a really good eye for modern
              and contemporary design.

              I have been mentoring (remotely) for 2 years at Code Institute.
              The major part of the mentorship sessions is focusing on the code
              quality of students' projects. I help students to think like
              professional developers from the very start of their coding
              career. The content agnosticism, don't repeat yourself,
              reusability and object orientation are principles that I encourage
              on every session. I advise my students to stay persistent,
              committed and curious.
